OpenSteerBlock
==============

OpenSteer branch to integrate with libCinder

Based on the svn verson revision 190 from http://sourceforge.net/p/opensteer/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/

I did not wrote OpenSteer, the credits are from other people that are just amazing!

Here are the propper credits as shown at OpenSteer page:

OpenSteer was initially developed by Craig Reynolds beginning in 2002 at the Research and Development group of Sony Computer Entertainment America. We wish to acknowledge the support of SCEA, SCEI and in particular these executives who had the foresight to release this code as open source for all to use: Shin'ichi Okamoto, Masa Chatani and Dominic Mallinson.

After OpenSteer's source code was first released on May 1, 2003 a group of dedicated volunteers quickly formed and began to extend the system. Ports to Windows and Mac OS X were contributed within 24 hours! Today we continue to discuss, test and improve OpenSteer. To contribute, or to just listen in, please visit the Open Discussion forum.
 
Here is a partial list of those who have contributed to OpenSteer, sorted roughly by the amount and "freshness" of their contributions: Bjoern Knafla (bknafla), Nick Porcino (meshula), Ben Forsyth (bforsyth), Dominik (inikofdoom), Paul (spanneradmin), Kris Hauser (kkhauser), Leaf Garland (leaf), Stefan Moises (beffy), Bruce Mitchener (brucem), Maciej Sinilo (yarpen), Michael Holm (gizwiz), Richard Cannock (perambulator).  Let us know of any omissions from this list.
